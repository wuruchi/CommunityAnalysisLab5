## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Reading the data
```{r}
IBEX<-read.table("data/Ibex0809.txt",sep="",header=T)
ENRON<-read.table("data/email-Enron.txt",sep="",header=T)
BRIGHTKITE<-read.table("data/loc-brightkite_edges.txt",sep="",header=T)
```

## Testing edge-betweenness
```{r}

GN<-edge.betweenness.community(IBEX)
dendPlot(GN)
